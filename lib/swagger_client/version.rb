#The Blue Alliance API v3

## Overview    Information and statistics about FIRST Robotics Competition teams and events.   # Authentication   All endpoints require an Auth Key to be passed in the header `X-TBA-Auth-Key`. If you do not have an auth key yet, you can obtain one from your [Account Page](/account).    A `User-Agent` header may need to be set to prevent a 403 Unauthorized error.
